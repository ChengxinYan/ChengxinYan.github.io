## About Me

Hi! My name is Chengxin, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Probability and Mathematical Statistics at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Nankai University. My research interests include stochastic calculus/processes, stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), stochastic optimazation, mathematical finance, and operations management. 
In the past few years I have been mainly engaged in theoretical research on SDEs and SPDEs, and now I am committed to applying stochastic techniques to mathematical finance and operations management.
For more information about my academic publications, please refer to my curriculum vitae (CV).
